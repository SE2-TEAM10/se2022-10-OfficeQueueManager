TEMPLATE FOR RETROSPECTIVE (Team 10)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done:1 vs 1
- Total points committed vs. done: 3 vs 3
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team): 48h vs 43h 30m

**Remember**a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:

- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD if required (you cannot remove items!)

### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#1_   |    7    |    3  |      48     |       43h 30m      |

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual)
- Average estime: 6h 51m
- average actual: 6h 13m
- Deviation estime: 2h 42m
- Deviation actual: 5h 12m

- Total task estimation error ratio: 0.1

## QUALITY MEASURES

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 0h
  - Total hours spent: 0h
  - Nr of automated unit test cases: 0
  - Coverage (if available): 0%
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 0h
  - Total hours spent: 1h
- Code review
  - Total hours estimated: 0h
  - Total hours spent: 3h
  
## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

  - The biggest error in estimation was the DB related issues. We estimated them too much.

  - We didn't estimate unit testing, e2e testing and code review. We did e2e tests and code review anyway.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

  - We have to improve in estimation and include unit tests, e2e tests and code review.

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?

   --
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

  --

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

  - We have to create more and smaller tasks.

  - Doing planning as fast as possible

> Propose one or two

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!

  - Team working and communication were fine ;)
